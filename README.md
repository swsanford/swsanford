Hey my name is Stephen Sanford. With experience in both electrical and software engineering, I'm looking for
employment. Outside of professional experience, I've created a few side projects including games made in Unity
and Unreal Engine 5, a web scraper & residential real estate analyzer, and a tool that assists in choosing and
weighting stocks for a stock portfolio.
